This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/C64_MiSTer) Commodore 64 core which
itself is based on
[FPGA64](https://www.syntiac.com/fpga64.html) by Peter Wendrich.

[MJoergen](https://github.com/MJoergen) and
[sy2002](http://www.sy2002.de) ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2021.

The core uses the [MiSTer2MEGA65](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65)
framework and [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
FAT32 support (loading loading ROMs, mounting disks) and for the
on-screen-menu.

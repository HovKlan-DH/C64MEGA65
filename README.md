Commodore 64 for MEGA65 - version 4
===================================

This project is copied directly from the Commodore 64 for [MEGA65 project](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65) and is fully done by [sy2002](https://github.com/sy2002) and [MJoergen](https://github.com/MJoergen).

My purpose here is solely to **tweak the help menu**, to reflect my wishes for an improvement - that means different **colors**, **layout** and **font** - that's it. The core itself will not be touched at all, as I have no idea what this is doing :-)

I will update with the steps I have done and how it looks like.

This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/C64_MiSTer) Commodore 64 core which
itself is based on
[FPGA64](https://www.syntiac.com/fpga64.html) by Peter Wendrich.

[MJoergen](https://github.com/MJoergen) and
[sy2002](http://www.sy2002.de) ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2021.

The core uses the [MiSTer2MEGA65](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65)
framework and [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
FAT32 support (loading loading ROMs, mounting disks) and for the
on-screen-menu.

Features
--------

With our [Release 1](VERSIONS.md), we are striving for a **retro C64 PAL
experience**: The core turns your MEGA65 into a Commodore 64, with a
C1541 drive and a pair of Joysticks. No frills. The C64 runs the original
Commodore KERNAL and the C1541 runs the original Commodore DOS, which leads to
authentic loading speeds. You will be surprised, how slowly the C64/C1541
were loading... :-)

And you will be amazed by the 99.9% compatibility that this core has when it
comes to games, demos and other demanding C64 software. Some demos are even
recognizing this core as genuine C64 hardware.

### Video and Audio

* HDMI: The core outputs 1280Ã—720 pixels (720p) at 50 Hz and HDMI audio at
  a sampling rate of 48 kHz. This is supported by a vast majority of monitors
  and TVs. In case of compatibility problems, you can switch the HDMI video
  out to 60 Hz (without affecting the PAL core's internal 50 Hz), but this
  would lead to a slightly jerky experience when it comes to scrolling and
  other fast movements on the screen. The 4:3 ascpect ratio of
  the C64's output is preserved during upscaling, so that even though 720p
  is a 16:9 picture, the C64 looks pixel perfect and authentic on HDMI.
  
* VGA: For a true retro feeling, we are providing a 4:3 image via the
  MEGA65's VGA port, so that you can connect real CRT monitors or older
  4:3 LCD/TFT displays. The resolution is 720x576 pixels and the frequency
  is 50 Hz in PAL mode.
  
* Retro 15KHz RGB over VGA: This is for the ultimate retro experience:
  Connect an old Scart TV (for example using
  [this](https://ultimatemister.com/product/rgb-scart-cable/)
  cable) or an old RGB-capable monitor (by soldering your own cable)
  to MEGA65's VGA port.
  
#### Flicker-free HDMI

@TODO document "Best", "OK" and "Off" here and describe the respective
ideas behind these settings
  
### Convenience

* On-Screen-Menu via the MEGA65's <kbd>Help</kbd> key to mount disk images
  and to configure the core
* Realtime switching between a 6581 SID and a 8580 SID
* CRT filter: Optional visual scanlines so that the output looks more like
  an old monitor or TV
* Crop/Zoom: On HDMI, you can optionally crop the top and bottom border of
  the C64's output and zoom in, so that the 16:9 screen real-estate is
  better utilized and you have a larger picture. Great for games.
* Audio processing: Optionally improve the raw audio output of the system

Installation
------------

1. [Download @TODO LINK](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/edit/dev-mount/README.md)
   the ZIP file that contains the bitstream and the core file and unpack it.
2. Choose the right subfolder depending on the type of your MEGA65:
   `R2` or `R3`. If you are not sure which one to choose, it likely that
   you have an `R3`. You will need the `.cor` file.
3. Read the section "How do I install an alternative MEGA65 core?" on the
   [alternative MEGA65 cores](https://sy2002.github.io/m65cores/index.html)
   website or read the section "Bitstream Utility" in the
   [MEGA65 Starter Guide](https://files.mega65.org/news/MEGA65-Starter-Guide.pdf).
4. The core supports FAT32 formatted SD cards to mount `.D64` disk images
   for the C1541 at drive 8.
5. If you put your disk images into a folder called `/c64`, then the core will
   display this folder on startup. Otherwise the root folder will be shown.

If you are a developer and/or have a JTAG adaptor connected to your MEGA65,
then you can use the `.bit` file from the ZIP instead of the `.cor` file:
Run the [M65 tool](https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-tools) using this
syntax `m65 -q yourbitstream.bit` and the core will be immediately loaded
into the FPGA of the MEGA65 and automatically started.

How to use the file- and directory browser for mounting a disk image
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Long filename support
* Alphabetically sorted file- and directory listings
* Navigate up/down using the <kbd>Cursor up</kbd> and
  <kbd>Cursor down</kbd> keys
* Page up and page down using the <kbd>Cursor left</kbd> and
  <kbd>Cursor right</kbd> keys
* <kbd>Return</kbd> mounts a disk image
* <kbd>Run/Stop</kbd> exits the file browser without mounting
* Remembers the browsing history, i.e. even while you climb directory trees,
  when you mount the next image, the file selection cursor stands where you
  left off. This is very convenient for mounting multiple subsequent
  disks of a demo in a row.
* Support for both SD card slots: The back slot has precedence over the bottom
  slot: As soon as you insert a card to the back slot, this card is being
  used. SD card changes are detected in real-time; also while being in the
  file browser.
* While being in the browser you can use <kbd>F1</kbd> to manually select
  the internal SD card (bottom tray) and <kbd>F3</kbd> to select the
  external SD card (back slot).
* The disk image is internally buffered, that means you can remove or
  switch the SD card even while the C64 is accessing the disk.
* An already mounted drive can be unmounted (i.e. "switch the drive off"), if
  you select it in the <kbd>Help</kbd> menu using the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar.
  If you select an already mounted drive with the <kbd>Return</kbd> key
  instead, then for the C64 this is more like switching a diskette while
  leaving the drive on. Use the latter mechanism via <kbd>Return</kbd> when
  a game or a demo asks you to turn the disk or to insert another disk.
* The file browser defaults to the folder `/c64` in case this folder exists.
  Otherwise it starts at the root folder.
* The file browser only shows files with a valid file extension.
  Currently, we only suppoert `.d64`.

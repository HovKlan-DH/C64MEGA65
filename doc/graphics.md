# Notes about the C64 graphics output

## Measurements of the C64 MiSTER core output
The video is generated by the `main_clk` running at approximately 31.5 MHz.
Every four clock cycles a new pixel is generated.

### Horizontal timing
All values are relative to rising edge of hsync:
| Event              | pixels  |
| -----              | ------: |
| Hsync start        |   0     |
| Left border start  |  89     |
| Hsync end          | 100     |
| Display area start | 139     |
| Right border start | 459     |
| Blanking start     | 497     |
| Hsync start        | 504     |

Therefore:
| Size          | pixels  |
| -----         | ------: |
| Left border   |  50     |
| Right border  |  38     |

### Vertical timing
All values are relative to rising edge of vsync:

| Event              | pixels  |
| -----              | ------: |
| Vsync start        |   0     |
| Vsync end          |   1     |
| Display area start |  63     |
| Display area end   | 262     |
| Vsync start        | 312     |

The above shows that the C64 core does not implement vertical blanking, i.e.
the border is displayed for all 112 lines outside the display area.

So to summarize, the C64 core has the following output:
* The entire frame is 504x312 pixels
* The visible (non-blanked) area is 408x312 pixels
* The display area is 320x200 pixels

## Comparison with other documentation
Now compare the above numbers with the following
[link](http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/vic-ii.txt) (see "6569 PAL-B"):
* Left border : 48 pixels (0x18-0x1e0+0x1f8)
* Screen : 320 pixels (0x158-0x18)
* Right border : 36 pixels (0x17c-0x158)
* Blanking : 100 pixels (0x1e0-0x17c)
* TOTAL : 504 pixels

These numbers match very closely with the C64 core. The only difference is that
the left and right border have been widened with 2 pixels each.

From the same document we get the following vertical values
* Top border : 51-16 = 35 lines
* Screen : 251-51 = 200 lines
* Bottom border : 300-251 = 49 lines
* Blanking : 16-300+312 = 28 lines
* TOTAL : 312 lines

The visible (non-blanked) area is 404x284 pixels.

Finally, [this link](https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:visible_area)
reports a total visible area of 402x292 pixels.

## Frequencies
The original C64 PAL mode has a crystal oscillator of 17.734475 MHz that is
divided down by a factor of 18 to 0.985249 MHz.

The horizontal frequency is calculated as 0.985249 MHz / 63 = 15.639 kHz, i.e. a
scan line period of 63.943 us.

The total frame time is 312x63.943 us = 19.9503 ms, i.e. a frame rate of 50.1246 Hz.

## Aspect ratio
The aspect ratio is 504/312 = 1.377 including border, and 320/200 = 1.600 without
the border. These values are close to 4/3 = 1.333 and 16/9 = 1.778,
respectively. In other words, with border the visible screen displays nicely in
4/3 aspect ratio, whereas the inside field (perhaps with a small amout of
border) will display nicely in 16/9 aspect ratio.

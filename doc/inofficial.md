### Version 5 Work-in-Progress: List of inofficial builds

The purpose of this list is to track down regressions introduced in newer
builds that were not there in older builds. By finding the last known-to-work
build, we have a better chance to hunt down problems. The name of the build
can be checked in the "About & Help" menu of the core.

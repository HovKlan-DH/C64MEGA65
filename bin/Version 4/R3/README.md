C64 for MEGA65
==============

Experience the Commodore 64 with great accuracy and sublime compatibility
on your MEGA65!

This core is based on the MiSTer Commodore 64 core which itself is based on
the work of many others.

MJoergen and sy2002 ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2022.

With our Release 4, we are striving for a **retro C64 PAL experience**:
The core turns your MEGA65 into a Commodore 64, with a C1541 drive, a pair of
Joysticks, a Mouse and/or Paddles. No frills but optionally including a
512KB 1750 REU. The C64 runs the original Commodore KERNAL and the C1541 runs
the original Commodore DOS, which leads to authentic loading speeds.
You will be surprised, how slowly the C64/C1541 were loading... :-)

And you will be amazed by the 99.9% compatibility that this core has when it
comes to games, demos and other demanding C64 software. Some demos are even
recognizing this core as genuine C64 hardware.

IMPORTANT: Right now we are only supporting MEGA65 R3, R3A and newer. R2
machines are not supported, yet. This might change in future.

Watch this YouTube video to learn how to install the core:

If you want the core to remember the settings you made in the on-screen-menu,
then make sure that you copy the following file (`c64mega65`) into a folder
called `/c64`. This `c64` folder needs to be located in the root folder of the
SD card that is active when you boot the core:

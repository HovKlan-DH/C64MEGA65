Make sure you have a look at the [User's Manual](https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/blob/V1/README.md).

### Reset Bugfix

In case you experience the "ambulance light" problem or problems
with MEGA65's reset button while using the core, use
`C64MEGA65-1-R3-resetfix-100MHz.cor`
and `C64MEGA65-1-R3-resetfix-100MHz.bit`.

Caution: Only use these unofficial versions in case you experience problems
with the reset button. Otherwise stick with the official release.

### 15kHz Retro RGB fix

If you use the 15kHz Retro RGB mode (via VGA) and experience problems with
the on-screen-menu (for example distortion), then use this fix, which
also contains the reset bugfix: `15kHz-retro-fix.cor`
and `15kHz-retro-fix.bit`.

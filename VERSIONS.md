Version 4 - MONTH, DD, YYYY
===========================

Write support for the C1541 is the main feature of this release: Save your
high-scores and your progress in games that support it and work with GEOS.

## New Features

WIP C1541 write support: Ability to write to D64 image files on the SD card.

## Changes

* Reduced joystick latency from 5ms to 1ms by decreasing the stable time of
  the signal debouncer.

TODO: C64 Mouse should work (since paddles work): Check with MouSTer and any
  mouse checking tool: If Mouse works: Mention it here in versions; otherwise
  re-add "Mouse" to ROADMAP.md and README.md

TODO: Check GEOS: Mouse + writing to D64 disk images

TODO: @MH discuss with @MJoergen: Can we improve the HDMI reliability, i.e.
  ability to run on more displays by using PBLOCKs? What triggered this idea
  is this post on Discord:

  We did not change anything in the core when it comes to HDMI, so the only
  thing that changed in this respect was the random placement of the HDMI
  component in another run of Vivado.

Version 3 - June, 27 2022
=========================

This version is mainly a bugfix & compatibility release that is meant to
heavily increase the C64 compatibility of the core. It also adds support
for Paddles.

## New feature

* Support for Paddles added: Connect compatible paddles to the joystick ports.

## Bugfixes

* CIA Bug fixed: The bug prevented demos like Comalight and Apparatus to run
  and in games like Commando, the joystick's fire button did not work.

* CIA Bug fixed: "icr3 set priority over clear", merged from from MiSTer to
  our codebase. This bug prevented games like Arkanoid to run.

* User Port "low active" bug fixed: The bug prevented games like
  Bomberman C64, that support a Multiplayer Joystick Interface
  (https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Multiplayer_Interface), to work. Reason is,
  that due to the low-active nature of the User Port these games detected
  "ghost activites" on the (not existent) joystick connected via User Port.

* Zero Page register $01 has the correct default value $37 now. It had the
  wrong value $C7 due to two bugs that have been fixed:
  (a) The Cassette Port's s SENSE and READ input are low active.
  (b) The wrapper code that turns the 6502 into a 6510 contained a bug.

Version 2 - June, 18 2022
=========================

This version is mainly a bugfix & stability release: The focus was not to add
a lot of new features, but to make sure that the C64 core works flawlessly
with more MEGA65 machines than version 1 did. We also added a DVI option
(see below) to increase the amount of displays that work with the core.

## Bugfixes

* MAX10 reset bug fixed: Fixes the "ambulance lights" problem when starting
  the core and fixes non-working reset buttons
* SD card problem fixed: When neither any D64 file was present on the SD card
  and additionally, there was not a single subdirectory, then the core
  crashed with "Corrupt memory structure: Linked-list boundary" when one tried
  to mount a disk.
* Fixed distorted On-Screen-Menu in "VGA Retro 15KHz RGB" mode

## DVI Option

* The DVI option is meant to improve the compatibility with certain monitors.
  Choosing "HDMI: DVI (no sound)" in the On-Screen-Menu will activate it and
  thus stop sending sound packages within the HDMI data stream.

Version 1 - April, 26 2022
==========================

Experience the Commodore 64 with great accuracy and sublime compatibility
on your MEGA65! It can run a ton of games and demos and it offers convenient
features.

## Features

* PAL standard C64 (running standard KERNAL and standard C1541 DOS)
* PAL 720 x 576 pixels (4:3) @ 50 Hz via VGA: for a true retro feeling
* 720p @ 50 Hz or 60 Hz (16:9) via HDMI: for convenience
* Sound output via 3.5mm jack and via HDMI
* SID 6581 and 8580
* MEGA65 keyboard support (including cursor keys)
* Joystick support
* On-Screen-Menu via Help button to mount drives and to configure options
* C1541 read-only support: Mount standard `*.D64` via SD card to drive 8
* Drive led during virtual disk access
* CRT filter: Optional visual scanlines on HDMI so that the output looks more
  like an old monitor or TV
* Crop/Zoom: On HDMI, you can optionally crop the top and bottom border of
  the C64's output and zoom in, so that the 16:9 screen real-estate is
  utilized more efficiently. Great for games.
* Audio processing: Optionally improve the raw audio output of the system
* Smart reset: Press the reset button briefly and only the C64 core is being
  reset; press it longer than 1.5 seconds and the whole machine is reset.

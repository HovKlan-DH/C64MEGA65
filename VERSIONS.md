Version 4 - MONTH, DD, YYYY
===========================

RELEASE CURRENTLY PLANNED "BEFORE CHRISTMAS" or "OVER THE NEW YEAR".

BETA 2 RELEASED ON November 19 2022

Productivity release: Write support for the virtual C1541 and a 512 KB RAM
Expansion Unit (1750 REU) are the main features: Save your high-scores and
your gaming progress to disk (D64) and work productively with GEOS by speeding
up 10x using the REU and by saving your work persistently to disk.
And the demo fans can now enjoy all the awesome REU releases on CSDB.

## New Features

* C1541 write support using D64 image files on the SD card.
WIP Formatting does not work, yet - to be fixed until release

* 1750 REU support: The REU is as close to cycle accurate as it can go. It is
  not perfect, but 99.9% perfect - it even runs the picky
  [TreuLove_ForReal1750Reu.d64](http://csdb.dk/getinternalfile.php/144854/TreuLove_ForReal1750Reu.d64)
  version of Booze Design's Treu Love demo
  ([see CSDB page](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=144105))
  that is supposed to only run on real hardware. The REU also works perfectly
  with GEOS. You can switch the REU on/off using the options menu.

WIP Choice between 16:9 or 4:3 HDMI output resolutions: By default the core
  outputs 720p on HDMI which is a 16:9 resolution (even though the actual
  C64's output is pixel-perfect 4:3 as we are adding black bars left and
  right). With this new feature you can switch from 720p to PAL over HDMI
  which is a native 4:3 resolution (@TODO resolution). This is feature is 
  essential if you want to connect to a 4:3 monitor over HDMI.

WIP Ability to save the configuration settings of the core. You need to copy
  the file .c64mega65 to the folder /c64 to activate this feature.

* Mouse: Support for C64 mice and MouSTer

* Reduced joystick latency from 5ms to 1ms by decreasing the stable time of
  the signal debouncer.

## Bugfixes

* The drive led is not blinking any more during normal read/write operations.
  It behaves now like the real drive led and only blinks on errors.

* Fixed a small (probably inaudible) SID bug by merging
  [this](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/C64_MiSTer/commit/711dffbddf0b591fadfe81e4e3ed4dd3af6be143)
  an upstream fix from MiSTer.

TODO: @MH discuss with @MJoergen: Can we improve the HDMI reliability, i.e.
  ability to run on more displays by using PBLOCKs? What triggered this idea
  is this post on Discord:
  https://discord.com/channels/719326990221574164/794775503818588200/991106092539068476
  We did not change anything in the core when it comes to HDMI, so the only
  thing that changed in this respect was the random placement of the HDMI
  component in another run of Vivado.

Version 3 - June, 27 2022
=========================

This version is mainly a bugfix & compatibility release that is meant to
heavily increase the C64 compatibility of the core. It also adds support
for Paddles.

## New feature

* Support for Paddles added: Connect compatible paddles to the joystick ports.

## Bugfixes

* CIA Bug fixed: The bug prevented demos like Comalight and Apparatus to run
  and in games like Commando, the joystick's fire button did not work.

* CIA Bug fixed: "icr3 set priority over clear", merged from from MiSTer to
  our codebase. This bug prevented games like Arkanoid to run.

* User Port "low active" bug fixed: The bug prevented games like
  Bomberman C64, that support a Multiplayer Joystick Interface
  (https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Multiplayer_Interface), to work. Reason is,
  that due to the low-active nature of the User Port these games detected
  "ghost activites" on the (not existent) joystick connected via User Port.

* Zero Page register $01 has the correct default value $37 now. It had the
  wrong value $C7 due to two bugs that have been fixed:
  (a) The Cassette Port's s SENSE and READ input are low active.
  (b) The wrapper code that turns the 6502 into a 6510 contained a bug.

Version 2 - June, 18 2022
=========================

This version is mainly a bugfix & stability release: The focus was not to add
a lot of new features, but to make sure that the C64 core works flawlessly
with more MEGA65 machines than version 1 did. We also added a DVI option
(see below) to increase the amount of displays that work with the core.

## Bugfixes

* MAX10 reset bug fixed: Fixes the "ambulance lights" problem when starting
  the core and fixes non-working reset buttons
* SD card problem fixed: When neither any D64 file was present on the SD card
  and additionally, there was not a single subdirectory, then the core
  crashed with "Corrupt memory structure: Linked-list boundary" when one tried
  to mount a disk.
* Fixed distorted On-Screen-Menu in "VGA Retro 15KHz RGB" mode

## DVI Option

* The DVI option is meant to improve the compatibility with certain monitors.
  Choosing "HDMI: DVI (no sound)" in the On-Screen-Menu will activate it and
  thus stop sending sound packages within the HDMI data stream.

Version 1 - April, 26 2022
==========================

Experience the Commodore 64 with great accuracy and sublime compatibility
on your MEGA65! It can run a ton of games and demos and it offers convenient
features.

## Features

* PAL standard C64 (running standard KERNAL and standard C1541 DOS)
* PAL 720 x 576 pixels (4:3) @ 50 Hz via VGA: for a true retro feeling
* 720p @ 50 Hz or 60 Hz (16:9) via HDMI: for convenience
* Sound output via 3.5mm jack and via HDMI
* SID 6581 and 8580
* MEGA65 keyboard support (including cursor keys)
* Joystick support
* On-Screen-Menu via Help button to mount drives and to configure options
* C1541 read-only support: Mount standard `*.D64` via SD card to drive 8
* Drive led during virtual disk access
* CRT filter: Optional visual scanlines on HDMI so that the output looks more
  like an old monitor or TV
* Crop/Zoom: On HDMI, you can optionally crop the top and bottom border of
  the C64's output and zoom in, so that the 16:9 screen real-estate is
  utilized more efficiently. Great for games.
* Audio processing: Optionally improve the raw audio output of the system
* Smart reset: Press the reset button briefly and only the C64 core is being
  reset; press it longer than 1.5 seconds and the whole machine is reset.
